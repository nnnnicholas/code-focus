# OAuth Fix Resolution

## The Problem
GitHub OAuth was failing with a 404 error because the OAuth URL contained `%0A` (newline character) after the client ID:
```
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=Ov23li4TtKu7i2rEEGsB%0A&scope=...
```

## Root Cause
The GITHUB_ID environment variable in Vercel had a trailing newline character. This was likely added when the environment variable was first set.

## The Solution
Fixed by force-updating the Vercel environment variable WITHOUT any newline:

```bash
# Create a file with the client ID without newline
echo -n "Ov23li4TtKu7i2rEEGsB" > /tmp/github_id.txt

# Remove the old environment variable
vercel env rm GITHUB_ID production -y

# Add it back using the file (ensures no newline)
vercel env add GITHUB_ID production < /tmp/github_id.txt

# Force deploy to pick up the clean environment variable
vercel --prod --force
```

## Key Points
- The issue was NOT in the code
- The issue was NOT in local .env files
- The issue WAS in the Vercel environment variable itself
- Using `echo -n` prevents adding a newline
- Piping through a file ensures clean input to `vercel env add`

## Verification
After this fix, the OAuth URL correctly shows:
```
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=Ov23li4TtKu7i2rEEGsB&scope=...
```
(Note: No `%0A` after the client ID)
